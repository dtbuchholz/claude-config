# Ralph Loop

An autonomous development loop for Claude Code. The key insight: **fresh context per
iteration** with **file I/O as state**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each iteration spawns a **new Claude session**. No transcript accumulation.

```
Iteration 1: claude -p "task.md" → works → exits
Iteration 2: claude -p "task.md" → sees files from iter 1 → works → exits
Iteration 3: claude -p "task.md" → sees files from iter 1+2 → works → exits
```

### 2. File I/O as State

All state lives in `.ralph/`:
- `spec.md` - The task specification (re-read each iteration)
- `state.json` - Iteration count, attempts, status
- `progress.log` - Append-only progress tracking
- `evidence/` - Proof of work (iteration outputs, test results)

### 3. Re-Anchoring Every Iteration

Before each iteration, Claude re-reads:
- The original task specification
- Current git state
- Test results from previous iteration
- Evidence of completed work

This prevents drift and ensures the model stays grounded in reality.

### 4. Failure Handling

- Track attempts per task
- Auto-block after N failures with a reason file
- Failed iterations don't pollute future context

## Directory Structure

```
.ralph/
├── spec.md              # Task specification (user-provided)
├── state.json           # Loop state (iteration, attempts, status)
├── progress.log         # Append-only execution log
├── evidence/            # Proof of work
│   ├── iter-001.log     # Raw output from iteration 1
│   ├── iter-002.log     # Raw output from iteration 2
│   └── ...
└── blocked.md           # If task gets stuck (reason + suggestions)
```

## Usage

### Initialize a Ralph Loop

```bash
# Create spec file and initialize state
/ralph-init "Build a REST API with CRUD operations. Tests must pass."
```

### Run the Loop

```bash
# External bash loop - run from terminal
~/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/ralph.sh
```

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check current state
cat .ralph/state.json | jq .

# View progress log
tail -f .ralph/progress.log

# See latest iteration output
cat .ralph/evidence/iter-*.log | tail -100
```

### Stop the Loop

The loop stops when:
1. Claude outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` (completion)
2. Max iterations reached (default: 25)
3. Max attempts per task exceeded (default: 5)
4. You press Ctrl+C

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `RALPH_MAX_ITERATIONS` - Max loop iterations (default: 25)
- `RALPH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` - Attempts before blocking (default: 5)
- `RALPH_TIMEOUT` - Seconds per iteration (default: 1800)
- `RALPH_PROMISE` - Completion promise text (default: DONE)
- `RALPH_MODEL` - Claude model to use

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Well-defined tasks with testable success criteria
- Tasks requiring iteration (get tests to pass)
- Overnight/unattended runs
- Tasks with automatic verification

**Not good for:**
- Tasks requiring human judgment
- Unclear success criteria
- Interactive exploration
